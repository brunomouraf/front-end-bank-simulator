## ðŸ’» Project

This project is a ladding page of a fictitious digital bank, with the objective of integrating Front-end with Back-end services developed by me.
I will leave the credits below the text to the person who made the Front-end code base available here on GitHub, however I made some screen additions and script changes so that the requests could be carried out.
I will make the Back-end code (Java) available in another repository with all instructions for integration and use.
I hope you like it and I'll be available for any questions.
